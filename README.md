# Some Stellar Survivor

Some Stellar Survivor is a semi-realistic hardcore modpack made for modpack veterans. It heavily relies on the three main mods of Tinkers' Construct, Astral Sorcery and Minecolonies.

Inspiration came from the modpacks of RLCraft and Adventures & Dungeons. With that said, the modpack is smaller than both of those, with only about 90 mods in total (TODO: add modlist).

I hope you enjoy it!

## Reporting a bug

Nobody is perfect. Not you, not me. Because of this, I expect bugs to occur. If you find one, I urge you to join my Discord (https://discord.gg/GM6XSqM) and report it there, in order to make sure it actually is a mistake on my side, not on yours. Once I approve it, please open an issue here on GitHub.

## Contributing to the pack

Please stick to the todos. Any help with those is appreciated.

## Into the modpack

**NOTE:** If you are too lazy to read this, upon **creating a world with default settings**, you will receive the short version of this as a book in-game.

When creating a new world, please **leave the world type with Terraforged**. Anything else will not work out as recommended, you may encounter bugs and disabled features! (Yes, there are disabled features. More on that later.)

Starting into the modpack, you will encounter many optical enhancements. Dynamic Surroundings, Enhanced Visuals, Item Physics and some other visual mods do their thing there. But, among other things, you will also notice a thirst bar.

That's right. Drinking is essential in this pack. For the beginning, right-clicking still water will do. Later, you will want to look into purifying water using a **Water Purifier** and making canteens.

Another thing you will note for sure is that the usual tools do not exist. Instead, you need to craft your tool parts at a **Part Builder** and put them together at a **Tool Station**.

Next up, mining. Keep in mind that **the deeper you go, the harder the blocks get**. I recommend only breaking about half a stack of stone, because it will take some time until you are able to smelt ores.

This is because you need to make a **Seared Heater** and a **Seared Melter** for that. And those two require lots of gravel, sand and clay - not exactly the things you would seek in a cave, except gravel maybe.

Also, by now, it'll be night. Skeletons, creepers and most other pesky mobs do not exist - except for zombies. Lots of zombies. Drowned, too. Make sure you have an extra sword with you! Getting a bed before night also might help.

As soon as you have both of those, place them above each other (melter at the top). Then, fill the melter with lava. For that, you must utilize **clay buckets**, which have a habit of breaking. Bringing a few of them is recommended.

To make iron ingots, you can **mold a brick shape** into a (red) **sand cast**. You can do the same with tool parts made at the part builder. Later on, it is recommended to make permanent gold casts. Also, using iron buckets is recommended by now. For more information, check out **Materials and You**, the guide book of **Tinkers' Construct**.

Sooner or later, you will find a diamond. As soon as that is the case, you can start using magic. Find a **magic shrine** and dig into its basement. There, place a crafting table and make a **Resonating Wand**. To continue with the **Astral Sorcery** mod, craft an **Astral Tome**.

Very soon now, you should also think of starting a colony. To do that, craft a **build tool** and a **town hall**. The Minecolonies mod will guide you from there.

And from here, it is your game. Build a flourishing city. Make the best tools you can think of, maybe also using a smeltery or even a scorched structure. Perform magic miracles. Or just go and see what the world has to offer. (Not that much, because most structures are disabled, but the new biomes are still worth a sight.)

A few things to note:

- Enchanting is disabled for players. You will need a specialist for that in your colony.
- The nether is disabled. Quartz is a side product of melting sand into the smeltery, most other materials can be accessed within Astral Sorcery.
- The end is also disabled. Again, most materials are accessible through Astral Sorcery.
- Most monsters are disabled. Zombies drop bones too, string can be crafted from wool. Other mob drops, such as gunpowder, spider eyes, ender pearls etc. do not exist.
- Redstone, glowstone, prismarine and a few other materials are locked behind Astral Sorcery and do not generate in the world.
- Minecolonies is the key to automation in this pack. No fancy technology, just people doing their job.
