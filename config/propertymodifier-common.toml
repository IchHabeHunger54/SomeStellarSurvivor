#Any invalid entries will result in a log warning, but will just be skipped, and working entries will work.
#Most entries will utilize a block, item or enchantment id, which needs to be in the modid:blockid, modid:itemid or modid:enchantmentid format, respectively. "minecraft:" is not optional.
#All of these support regex. So you could use .* to select all entries, or minecraft:.* to select all elements in the minecraft namespace. For further information, please consult Google.
#Entries are read from left to right, this means that entries will overwrite entries read before it if they modify the same block/item/enchantment.
#NBT and blockstates are currently not supported in any way.

[villager_trading]
	#Adds new villager trades. villager_x_trades defines the villager level (1-5). Due to technical reasons, if you add trades for a specific profession for a specific level, you need to re-add all trades for that profession level. E. g. if you wanted to add an enchanted book trade to a level 5 librarian, you need to re-add all other trades for a level 5 librarian as well. See https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Trading for the vanilla defaults
	#Format is profession;uses;xp;pricemultiplier;tradetype;tradetype-specific-args
	#profession: villager profession (e. g. minecraft:librarian)
	#uses: how often the trade can be traded before it is locked
	#xp: the amount of villager xp given to the villager
	#price multiplier: every time you trade with a villager, the selling price is multiplied with 1 - this value (e. g. 0.1 means that every time you use the trade, the price is lowered by 10%)
	#tradetype and corresponding tradetype-specific-args can take the following values (values in [] are optional):
	#  normal: buyItem1;buyItemCount1;[buyItem2;buyItemCount2;]sellItem;sellItemCount - a normal trade that takes 1 or 2 stacks in and gives 1 stack out. The items are item ids (e. g. minecraft:emerald), the item counts are numbers between 1 and 64
	#  dyed: buyItem1;buyItemCount1;[buyItem2;buyItemCount2;]sellItem" - the sell item (e. g. leather armor) will be randomly dyed
	#  map: buyItem1;buyItemCount1;[buyItem2;buyItemCount2;]structure;mapdecoration" - structure is a structure id (e. g. minecraft:stronghold), mapdecoration can be one of the following: "player", "frame", "red_marker", "blue_marker", "target_x", "target_point", "player_off_map", "player_off_limits", "mansion", "monument", "red_x", "banner_black", "banner_blue", "banner_brown", "banner_cyan", "banner_gray", "banner_green", "banner_light_blue", "banner_light_gray", "banner_lime", "banner_magenta", "banner_orange", "banner_pink", "banner_purple", "banner_red", "banner_white", "banner_yellow"
	#  enchantedbook: buyItem1;[buyItem2;buyItemCount2;]enchantment[;level] - enchantment to use (e. g. minecraft:sharpness, supports regex), level for the level (randomly selected if not stated). Outputs an enchanted book, at which the amount of buyItem1 is scaled - a lvl 5 book costs approx. 5 times more than a lvl 1 book. Adding more than one enchantment is impossible
	#  enchanteditem: buyItem1;[buyItem2;buyItemCount2;]sellItem;enchantment;level - enchantment to use (e. g. minecraft:sharpness, supports regex), level for the level (randomly selected if not stated). Outputs an enchanted book, at which the amount of buyItem1 is scaled - a lvl 5 helmet costs approx. 5 times more than a lvl 1 helmet. Adding more than one enchantment is impossible
	#  potion: buyItem1;buyItemCount1;[buyItem2;buyItemCount2;]sellItem;potion - the potion (supports regex, randomly selects one if multiple fit) is applied to the sell item, so unless you have additional potion-like items added by other mods, this should only be minecraft:potion, minecraft:splash_potion, minecraft:lingering_potion or minecraft:tipped_arrow
	#  stew: buyItem1;buyItemCount1;[buyItem2;buyItemCount2;]effect;duration - effect is an effect id (e. g. minecraft:strength), duration is the duration in ticks

[wandering_trader_trading]
	#Adds new wandering trader trades. Due to how the wandering trader works, there are two lists: normal and last trades. When the trader spawns, five normal trades and one last trade are each randomly chosen from their corresponding lists. Note that as soon as you add anything in any of the lists, it removes all other trades (including the ones from the other list), and only this mod's added trades remain, so you need to re-add most things if you only want to add one trade.
