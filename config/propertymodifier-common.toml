#A few general things to note:
#Any invalid entries will result in a log warning, but will just be skipped, and working entries will work.
#Most entries will utilize a block, item or enchantment id, which needs to be in the modid:blockid, modid:itemid or modid:enchantmentid format, respectively. "minecraft:" is not optional.
#Alternatively, you can use "any" instead of a block or item id to have the setting be applied to all blocks/items.
#Entries are read from left to right, so you'd better put "any"-entries to the left.
#NBT is currently not supported in any way.
